<p><b>Had the printing press not been made in 1440, I wouldâ€™ve never found my true loves in life. Literature.</b> Books have been important to me since I first learned how to read. I <i>love</i> to read, especially physical books. There is something about the feeling of the pages in your hand. The smell of a book brings me more joy than any other scent. Because of this love, I want nothing more than to work in book publishing.</p>

<p>Publishing is important as it allows people to share their words to those who will find comfort in them. Digital publishing has not only made the process of creating a book easier, it makes becoming a <i>writer</i> easier. We've seen examples of internet writers publishing their work, like <i><b>Natasha Preston</b></i>. I myself have been able to publish my work via digital platforms, something I am so grateful I can do.</p>

<p>Here is a video of one of my favorite authors talking about murder mysteries.</p>

<h2>This Was Rough</h2>
<p>See I wasn't expecting for this project utilizing Git Hub to be as difficult as it was. Prior to this project everything had been pretty smooth sailing. I understood Markdown pretty well. HTML took a little longer, but still not somthing I was worried about. 
So Mia of the past thought, "You know what future Mia, I think you'll be just fine." Past Mia was <b>very very</b> wrong. 

Before I get to the site in general, I will mention that prior to this my main struggle was with my images not showing with Markdown, but my links worked so I wasn't too upset about it. Though it wasn't my last fight with images (more on that later).

I was already so frustrated about my attempts to access the student account via Git Hub. So frsutrated, I honestly gave up and just decided to continue on. 
Then when it came to publshing my site, I was very confused on how you got your test photo essay to show up. I'm not sure if I missed something in your video demonstration, but it would automatically go to my ReadMe file. But then I fortunately figured out that it was just me being impatient. Once I gave the program a second, I was able to be directed to my Photo Essay. And then my next battle.  

I don't understand what I am doing with images that they don't want to appear nicely on my site, but I fought with the HTML code for a long time for the image. First I got rid of the alt text, but that only one of the images appeared. And the one that appeared was extremely blown up. So then I tried to give image dimensions. That didn't work. I looked into and typically the image doesn't show up if there is some disconnect with the source, but that made no sense to me because I uploaded them to repository. In the end, I tried renaming the file in my computer and then reuploading it to the repository. Which resulted in the pictures <b>FINALLY</b> appearing on the site. 

I've never wanted to throw my computer across the room more. But fortunatley, I didn't do that. 

All in all, I was able to figure it all out and have made the site you see before you! Hoped you enjoyed it.</p>
