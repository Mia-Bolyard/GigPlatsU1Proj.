<p><b>Had the printing press not been made in 1440, I wouldâ€™ve never found my true loves in life. Literature.</b> Books have been important to me since I first learned how to read. I <i>love</i> to read, especially physical books. There is something about the feeling of the pages in your hand. The smell of a book brings me more joy than any other scent. Because of this love, I want nothing more than to work in book publishing.</p>

<p>Publishing is important as it allows people to share their words to those who will find comfort in them. Digital publishing has not only made the process of creating a book easier, it makes becoming a <i>writer</i> easier. We've seen examples of internet writers publishing their work, like <i><b>Natasha Preston</b></i>. I myself have been able to publish my work via digital platforms, something I am so grateful I can do.</p>
