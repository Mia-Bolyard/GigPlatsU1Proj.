<title>Reflection on Project</title>
<h1>This was rough.</h1>
<p>See I wasn't expecting for this project utilizing Git Hub to be as difficult as it was. Prior to this project everything had been pretty smooth sailing. I understood Markdown pretty well. HTML took a little longer, but still not somthing I was worried about. 
So Mia of the past thought, "You know what future Mia, I think you'll be just fine." Past Mia was <b>very very</b> wrong. 

Before I get to the site in general, I will mention that prior to this my main struggle was with my images not showing with Markdown, but my links worked so I wasn't too upset about it. Though it wasn't my last fight with images (more on that later).

I was already so frustrated about my attempts to access the student account via Git Hub. So frsutrated, I honestly gave up and just decided to continue on. 
Then when it came to publshing my site, I was very confused on how you got your test photo essay to show up. I'm not sure if I missed something in your video demonstration, but it would automatically go to my ReadMe file. But then I fortunately figured out that it was just me being impatient. Once I gave the program a second, I was able to be directed to my Photo Essay. And then my next battle.  

I don't understand what I am doing with images that they don't want to appear nicely on my site, but I fought with the HTML code for a long time for the image. First I got rid of the alt text, but that only one of the images appeared. And the one that appeared was extremely blown up. So then I tried to give image dimensions. That didn't work. I looked into and typically the image doesn't show up if there is some disconnect with the source, but that made no sense to me because I uploaded them to repository. In the end, I tried renaming the file in my computer and then reuploading it to the repository. Which resulted in the pictures <b>FINALLY</b> appearing on the site. 

I've never wanted to throw my computer across the room more. But fortunatley, I didn't do that. 

All in all, I was able to figure it all out and have made the site you see before you! Hoped you enjoyed it.
