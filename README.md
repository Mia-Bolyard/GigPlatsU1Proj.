# Project Description.
**Hello there!**

Welcome to my Unit Project. This project is for Digital Platforms English 327 through the University of WI Green Bay Spring 2024. Here is a little description of the assignment per the instructions given to me. 

This project is dealing with the proccess of creating a site and utilizing certain digital languages such as Markdown or HTML. Throughout this Unit, I must say that learning Markdown and HTML and seeing it work in front of my eyes has been my absolute favorite part of the class so far. It just makes me feel like a super genius being able to write _this_ and <ins>this</ins>. 

Anyhoo, on this site is the HTML page I made for my Photo Essay. I also will have a reflection page for your reading enjoyment. Hope you enjoy my site!
